		<h3>Brick-oven pizza (Brooklyn style)</h3>
		<p>
			This simple brick-oven pizza recipe has been made famous by several
			well-known, Brooklyn wood-fire pizzerias. Best accompanied by
			ice-cold, pilsner-style lager beer.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1/4 cup warm water</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
			<li>1 cup cold water</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>3 cups bread flour</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Toppings</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
			<li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
			<li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1/2 cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
			<li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle
				yeast over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water
				and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.
			</li>
			<li>
				Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.
				Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with
				olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16
				hours. Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to
				rise.
			</li>
			<li>
				Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour
				prior to using.
			</li>
			<li>
				Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550
				degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
			</li>
			<li>
				Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour
				and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or
				about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.
			</li>
			<li>
				Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4
				teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly
				arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some
				empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.
			</li>
			<li>
				With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release
				from the peel easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of
				the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza
				is left on the stone.
			</li>
			<li>
				Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to
				6 minutes.
			</li>
			<li>
				Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then
				slide off the peel onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the
				basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.
			</li>
		</ol>
